A Home Matching prototype application that functions as a "Real Estate Agent," leveraging Large Language Models for content creation and vector databases for semantic search to deliver personalized real estate listings.

The HomeMatch.ipynb notebook consolidates the entire workflow for home listing management. It includes steps for generating property listings using a language model (LLM), saving these listings to a csv file, creating a vector database, capturing buyer preferences through user interface, searching for listings that match these preferences, preparing context from the search results, and finally, generating augmented property descriptions.

The home.csv file contains the dataset of generated home listings.
